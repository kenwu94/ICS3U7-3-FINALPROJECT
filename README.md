EXPLANATION FOR THE UPLOAD DISREPANCY
Parts of this code was made by Eric and Ken working in synchronous.
Ken would screenshare his IDE using an application to Eric, and the two would work on the code together in a voice call.
Most of the ideas for this game were also brainstormed mutually in this way.
However, because the code was on Ken's computer, Ken would upload it.
Therefore, most of the code was uploaded by Ken.
